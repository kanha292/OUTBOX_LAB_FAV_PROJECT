# ⚠️ Important Notice – Please Read Before Proceeding

I would like to clearly mention that I am **NOT sharing the full source code, APK, or any sensitive files related to this project publicly**.

🔒 The reason is purely **ethical and responsible disclosure**.  
Sharing the full details of this project could lead to potential misuse or unauthorized exploitation of a real security vulnerability present in the Utkarsh application’s payment system.

🙏 I kindly request you to please read this full README carefully to understand the purpose of the project, the learning outcomes, and why I am sharing only this high-level explanation.

This project is shared **ONLY for the Outbox Labs internship assignment purpose**, and once the interview process is completed – whether I get selected or not – I will permanently remove this project from all public or private locations.

Thank you very much for your understanding and time.

# 🚀 Reverse Engineering & Payment Bypass – Utkarsh App (Technical Research Project)

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **technical research project** where I performed **reverse engineering** on an Android application named **Utkarsh**.

The main purpose of this project was to study the internal architecture of the app, especially focusing on the **payment integration system**.  
By carefully decoding the APK and analyzing its source code, I discovered several security vulnerabilities that allowed me to modify and bypass the payment flow entirely.

What makes this project unique is my application of **AI prompt engineering skills**.  
Instead of relying solely on automated tools, I designed specific prompts to get meaningful help from AI models during complex code analysis.  
This approach allowed me to better understand the code structure, extract patterns, and design creative solutions that no AI tool could do automatically.

## ⚡ Key Highlights

### ✅ Reverse engineered the app by decoding the APK and studying its full architecture.

### ✅ Analyzed and understood the **payment system logic and flow** in depth.

### ✅ Identified key vulnerable methods and modified the code to bypass the payment verification.

### ✅ Successfully accessed paid services for free through the modified app.

### ✅ Applied **AI prompt engineering** to speed up code analysis and problem-solving.

### ✅ Demonstrated a real-world security gap in Utkarsh Services implementation.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to combine reverse engineering skills, software design knowledge, and AI-assisted problem-solving.  
It deepened my understanding of **app security, backend development, and critical thinking in a real-world environment**.

Thank you very much for your understanding.

# üöÄ Reverse Engineering & Payment Bypass ‚Äì Utkarsh App (Technical Research Project)

## üìã Project Overview

This is a **technical research project** where I performed **reverse engineering** on an Android application named **Utkarsh**.

The main purpose of this project was to study the internal architecture of the app, especially focusing on the **payment integration system**.  
By carefully decoding the APK and analyzing its source code, I discovered several security vulnerabilities that allowed me to modify and bypass the payment flow entirely.

What makes this project unique is my application of **AI prompt engineering skills**.  
Instead of relying solely on automated tools, I designed specific prompts to get meaningful help from AI models during complex code analysis.  
This approach allowed me to better understand the code structure, extract patterns, and design creative solutions that no AI tool could do automatically.

## ‚ö° Key Highlights

### ‚úÖ Reverse engineered the app by decoding the APK and studying its full architecture.

### ‚úÖ Analyzed and understood the **payment system logic and flow** in depth.

### ‚úÖ Identified key vulnerable methods and modified the code to bypass the payment verification.

### ‚úÖ Successfully accessed paid services for free through the modified app.

### ‚úÖ Applied **AI prompt engineering** to speed up code analysis and problem-solving.

### ‚úÖ Demonstrated a real-world security gap in Utkarsh Services implementation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

For **ethical reasons and responsible disclosure**, I am not sharing the full source code or APK publicly.  
Exposing the full details could lead to misuse or unauthorized exploitation of the security gap.

This project is shared **only for Outbox Labs internship assignment purposes**.  
Once the interview process completes, whether successful or not, I will permanently remove this project from any public or private repository.

## üéØ Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to combine reverse engineering skills, software design knowledge, and AI-assisted problem-solving.  
It deepened my understanding of **app security, backend development, and critical thinking in a real-world environment**.

Thank you for understanding.
